        </div>
        <p>
          The aim was to create a simple app using the Spotify API in order to get comfortable with the Authorisation
          and methodology before jumping into other Spotify based projects.
          The project was heavily inspired by the Spotify based webapps often shared on twitter, where users share their
          results on the app and compare their results with their followers. </p>

          <span>Research.</span>
        </div>
        <p>I had never worked with an API that required a user to sign in so I had no idea how to handle authorisation.
          So I focused the majority of my research on how to handle user authorisation and how to connect that to a
          React app.
          My <a href="https://medium.com/@thatissofetch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> goes in
          depth on the reserach and process I went through to build this webapp.

          <span>Design Concept.</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          For this project, I really wanted a bold and bright user interface. I initially wanted to use colors that
          matched the Spotify color pallete before deciding to go for a yellow, tangerine, black and white color scheme.
          I wanted the project to be bright and bold but as simple as possible. I achieved this by keeping descriptions
          brief and using bold lettering.

          <span>Brief.</span>
        </div>
        <p> For Explanations the aim was to create a critical thinking exercise that could exist on the web. 
          The project was modelled after other card games like <i>We're not really strangers.</i> that use 
          prompts to get people talking about serious topics.

          <span>Research.</span>
        </div>
        <p>The research was mostly focused on making a card game that can be accessed online while also delivering quality UI.
          I started out with cards that flip around when clicked but when I became aware of material design practises, I began the 
          process of making the cards more user-friendly while also adhering to material design standards.

          <span>Design Concept.</span>
        </div>
        <p>
         In terms of design concept, I wanted the design to reflect community. I did this through the use of color and imagery
         that had people from different walks of live interacting with each other. I focused on  creating a clean and seamless UI for users.

          <span>Development.</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          This was a straight-forward development process. I opted for SCSS because it allowed me to do major changes in the design 
          of the project through the use of variables and mix-ins. It has also allowed maintennace of the site to be much more efficient.
